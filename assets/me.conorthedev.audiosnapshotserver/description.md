*Where do you get the audio data for your visualizer? I pull it out of my ASS.*

This is a modified verison of Nepeta's ASS (AudioSnapshotServer), which is a TCP/IP server to fetch audio buffer's snapshot from mediaserverd.

**This tweak by itself does nothing noticeable. A client tweak is neccessary for visible effects - try [Mitsuha Forever](https://github.com/ConorTheDev/MitsuhaForever/)**

**Notes:**
- AudioSnapshotServer is [open source](https://github.com/cbyrne/AudioSnapshotServer), be sure to check out the code if you're interested.
